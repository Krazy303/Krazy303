## 🎮 The Legend
- **🧲 Interested in:** Women in STEM (and magnetically attracting debugging sessions at 3 AM)
- **📚 Currently learning:** Magnetic induction, flux capacitors, and why my fans sound like a jet engine
- **🤝 Open to collaborate on:** Literally anything that doesn't require a permission slip from Dad™
- **📱 Reach me:** [@goswami_rushikesh](https://instagram.com/goswami_rushikesh) on Instagram (or just wait for my repos to go viral)
- **🎭 Pronouns:** He/Him (no runtime errors here)
- **⚡ Flex:** Built a full game on a **Pentium Gen 2 laptop** 🚀 (Most repos too. Yes, really.)

**The Krazy303 Guarantee:**
- ✨ Your code will run on *any* machine (because mine runs on a potato)
- 🎯 Performance optimization is my middle name (it's not, but should be)
- 🔧 I debug by vibes and perseverance (and Stack Overflow, let's be honest)
- 🚀 I proved that constraints ≠ limitations; they're just speedruns in disguise

## 🎨 Philosophy

> "They said it's impossible to build on a Pentium Gen 2. I said hold my ~~coffee~~ energy drink."

I'm a firm believer that:
- **Hardware is temporary, ideas are forever**
- **Every constraint is a creativity unlock**
- **If it works on my laptop, it works everywhere** (thermodynamically impossible, but aesthetically pleasing)
- **Bugs aren't features—they're alternative solutions** ™️

## 🔥 What's Here

🎮 **Game Dev** - Because AAA studios use my laptop's specs as a joke  
🛠️ **Weird Projects** - If it makes me go "wait, why did that work?", it's getting pushed  
📖 **Open Source** - Sharing the chaos, one commit at a time  
🤯 **Proof of Concept** - That your excuses aren't as valid as mine

## 🌟 Random Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Laptops Older Than Me | 1 |
| Times This Laptop Has Crashed | ∞ |
| Times I've Blamed RAM | Also ∞ |
| Belief in My Craft | 📈📈📈 |
| Professional Anxiety | 🚀🚀🚀 |

## 🎯 Currently Obsessing Over

- Physics simulations that don't require RTX 4090
- Making the internet work with 512MB of RAM (still possible, right?)
- Writing the most optimized code humanly possible (or inhumanly, standards aren't real)
- Proving that passion > processing power

## 🤝 Let's Connect

Got a wild idea? A cursed project? Need someone to roast your code with love? 

**I'm in.** 

Let's build something that'll either change the world or make a hilarious GitHub trending page post. Either way, it'll run on my Pentium.
