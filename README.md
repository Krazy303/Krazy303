- 👋 Hi, I'm @Krazy303
- 👀 I'm interested in: **Women in STEM** (and apparently impressing them with Pentium-era tech)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning: **Magnetic induction and flux** (my superpower is literally attracting bugs)
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on: **Projects that don't require parental consent** 😅
- 📫 How to reach me: [@goswami_rushikesh](https://instagram.com/goswami_rushikesh) on Instagram (or scream into the void)

### 💻 About Me
Passionate developer who believes that *constraints breed creativity*. If it runs on a Pentium Gen 2, it'll run anywhere. That's not optimization—that's a lifestyle.

### 🛠️ What You'll Find Here
- Projects that somehow survived 20+ year old hardware
- Code that proves you don't need the latest GPU to have ideas
- Proof that passion > processing power
